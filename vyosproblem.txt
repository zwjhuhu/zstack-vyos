1. dns 配置过时
WARNING: since VyOS 1.2.0, "service dns forwarding listen-on" is a limited compatibility option.
It will only make DNS forwarder listen on addresses assigned to the interface at the time of commit
which means it will NOT work properly with VRRP/clustering or addresses received from DHCP.
Please reconfigure your system with "service dns forwarding listen-address" instead.

2. DNS 找不到文件错
